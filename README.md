# Tabula Quattro

This font is a slightly modified version of the excellent [iA Writer Quattro S](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro/Static) font. For more information about iA Writer Quattro, please see the [announcement post](https://ia.net/writer/blog/a-typographic-christmas).

Despite its excellence, iA Writer Quattro S does have a key flaw: the different weights of the fonts are not tagged appropriately, leading software such as [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) to load the wrong weight. I decided to fix this.

In accordance with the OFL license, I have renamed the font to Tabula Quattro. Please examine the copyright statements and license files for more information.
